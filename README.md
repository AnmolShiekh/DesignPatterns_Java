# DesignPatterns_Java
Gang Of Four Design Patterns
Creation Patterns:
1) Singelton: One instance per class is allowed. Analogy: One president of a country
2) Factory Method (Interface): Let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Analogy: The hiring agency decides which worker to send forward.
3) Abstract Factory: Families of related object. Analogy: Furniture showroom selling chair, table of same design.
4) Builder: Construct complex objects step by step. Analogy: Car manufacturing -> Wheels, engine, interior, exterior body
5) Prototype: Creates new objects by copying existing ones. Analogy: Photocopy Machine
Structural Patterns:
1) Adapter: Adapt one interface to other. Analogy: Travel Plug Adapter
2) Bridge: Decouples abstraction from implementation: Analogy: remote control works with multiple TV brands.
3) Composite: Indvidual and Composite objects are treated the same. Analogy: Company hierarchy chart
4) Decorator: Add behavior to an existing class without altering the class. Analogy: extra toppings on pizza
5) Facade: Simplifies complex subsystems. Analogy: Hotel reception handling all services.
6) Flyweight: Shares common state between objects. Analogy: Chess pieces sharing shapes or colors.
7) Proxy: Placehodler controlling the access to methods of other class. Analogy: Assistant of a CEO
Behavioral Patterns:
1) Chain of Responsibility: Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Analogy: Help desk forwarding calls to relevant personal.
2) Command: Encapsulates a request as an object. Analogy: Remote control buttons passing commands. 
3) Interpreter: Defines grammer and interpret it. Analogy: Parser or expression evaluator.
4) Mediator: Centralize communication between objects. Analogy: Ai traffic controller, chat rooms.
5) Template Method: Defines algorithm skeleton with customizeable steps. Analogy: Baking recipe with varying ingredients.
6) Iterator: Sequentially accesses elements without exposing their underlined detailes. Analogy: TV remote channel buttons.
7) Memento: Saves and restores the object states. Analogy: Games Save and load
8) Observer: Notifies the dependent objects of changes. Analogy: Magazine Subscirption.
9) State: Changes behavior based on current state of the object. Analogy: Traffic Light.
10) Strategy: Selects an algorithm at run time. Analogy: Choosing routes in Google.
11) Visitor: Adds new operations without changing class. Analogy: Tour guide visiting places.
